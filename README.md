Seasonal air pollution analysis in Islamabad using HAZ-Scanner data
# Islamabad Air Quality Analysis

📍 **Project Summary**  
This project analyzes seasonal air pollution in Islamabad from March 2022 to February 2023 using HAZ-Scanner HIM-6000. It explores patterns in six pollutants: PM₁₀, SO₂, NO₂, NO, CO, and O₃. The data was processed, summarized, and visualized to support climate-informed urban policy.

📊 **Key Insights**
- PM₁₀ peaked at 171 µg/m³ in January
- SO₂ exceeded Pakistan NEQs by 12.8× in spring
- O₃ 8-hr values in March exceeded WHO guidelines by 512%
- Spearman correlation shows strong seasonal linkage

📁 **Repository Structure**
- `data/Monthly_Averages.xlsx`: Raw pollutant data by month
- `visuals/`: Seasonal graphs (PM₁₀, NO₂, O₃, etc.)
- `summary/Thesis_Policy_Summary.pdf`: Key findings & policy implications

🛠 **Tools Used**
Python · Excel · SPSS · HAZ-Scanner · Remote Sensing (NASA ARSET)

📌 **Next Steps**
- Recreate visualizations in Python
- Integrate satellite data (NASA GEE)
- Build an interactive dashboard using Dash or Streamlit
